On my timeline, I often see library announcements and releases.
Most of these cases tend to be "version released :tada:", and a changelog.

I have written before on the effort that goes into modern toolchains.
People have put in a lot of work, often undpaid and definitely out of their own time, to make the release.

I have a simple strategy for retweeting in those cases:
- Give praise
- Express your use case

## Express your use case

Changelogs often include new features.
Sometimes, they also include a couple of sample use-cases.
When those use-cases, or new possibilities, correspond with mine, I love to tweet about it.
Something that might seem obvious to you, might actually clarify the possibilities for someone else.

Also, as someone who maintains libraries themselves, I am often shy/wary of announcing all the use-cases in an announcement.
Seeing someone else, with their own concrete problem that I helped solve, always brings a smile to my face.

Here's a couple of examples

### Example 1: Eleventy

### Example 2: Rollup

## Wrapping up

What is a recent announcement that allowed you to solve real problems?
Consider pinging the authors and letting them know!
