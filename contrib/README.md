# Contrib

This directory contains the setup for a custom set of [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) utility classes.

I like tachyons for quick prototyping, but I don't want to use the colours and such. Thus, I'm making a custom build of it once. You could run this on every build, but I find that not needed for my purposes!
