Hi, my name is Fotis. I’m Greek, living in Finland, working as a software developer.

Previously, I was living in Edinburgh, where I got a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Informatics, specialising in Natural Language processing.

Nowadays, I find myself working on the frontend, focusing on accessibility, performance, and building a common understanding of the challenges we face.
I have had multiple sites tell me that "my surname is invalid", and that's even on the "not horrible" part of the spectrum that people encounter on the web :)

[In another life, I am a photographer](https://fotis.photos).
A way to articulate my thoughts when words fail me, perhaps.

Oh, I also like learning languages, but I think you’ve guessed that by now.

## Potentially helpful

That is indeed my surname. After some polling, I’m told this might help: Papa-doh-george-oh-poulos
