description: 'Exploring the pattern of linking to headings in a document.'

Recently, a co-worker asked me about the pattern of linking to headings as a fragment:

This is a pattern I see often in documentation sites, where the headings are linked from a Table of Contents. This seems like a good idea in that case. Typically, users will want to refer back or save a link for posterity, and exposing it helps with that goal.
